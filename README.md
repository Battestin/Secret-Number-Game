# Secret Number Game

A classic number guessing game built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  
The player must guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 30 â€” feedback is given after each attempt, and the total number of tries is tracked.

## ðŸŽ® How it Works

- A secret number between 1 and 30 is generated randomly
- The player is prompted to guess via browser `prompt()`
- Hints are provided: too high or too low
- When the player guesses correctly, a success message and attempt count are shown

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone or download the repo  
2. Make sure the folder contains:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `app.js`
   - An `img/` folder with `robot.png`, `trophy.png`, and background assets

3. Open `index.html` in a browser

> No build step needed â€” it's 100% frontend and works out of the box.
